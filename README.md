### Quality-Control-in-Concrete
Brief note about Concrete:
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. 
Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material.
